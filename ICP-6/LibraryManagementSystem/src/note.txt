Things to remember when working in Angular 6:
- Check book.js in routes and models folder to see if they are tied and bound together using Mongoose Model
- Check if you have successfully connected to MongoDB
- Check if book.js has methods defined in api.service.ts already such as Create, Update, Delete, and Read
- Check app.module.ts to see if all components have been imported and properly declared
- Check app.js for nodejs module import, mongoose, mongodb, and resource declaration
